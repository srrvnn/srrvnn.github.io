After an year with Angular, I wanted to give React a shot. The last few weeks, I read several articles about Getting Started with React. The first hurdle seesm to be all the decisions. JSX or not, Pre Compile or not, Browserify or not, Webpack or not, CommonJS or not, ES6 or not. That's too many questions to answer for a beginner. I just wanted to dive into React, and I would have loved if someone took for decisions for me, at least while I am up and running.

I started by searching on yeomen.io for a good React generator. I found React Starter Kit, and I must tell it put me into the Depth-First-Learning hell, and I am finding it difficult to come out of it.

React -> React Starter Kit -> Flux -> Browserify -> ES6+ async, await. -> WTF!

I know React is HTML in JS, I understand Components are resuable UI elements, and why Flux's uni-directional flow, React's Virtual DOM principles have advantages. For me to move on to building applications, I need how to's for all of these questions:

* How do I route?

* How do I hit an API?

* How do I Fluxify these React components?

* How do I setup a store?

* How do I setup a dispenser?

* How can I graduate from dangerouslySetInnerHTML?
